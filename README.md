# EFE's Injector

**EFE's Injector** is a C# Gorilla Tag injector, it can manage all type of BepinEx / Mono, it protects your DLL's from getting dumped, this will improve overtime, we hope that the Gorilla Tag community is willing to participate in this project and help fix any issues regarding the Injection Method, Protections or Shell Codes.

This project isn't licensed, you can use this code without anyone's permission which means that everyone in the Gorilla Tag community can fix this and edit it his own way to create his own loader.

Made with LOVE, EFE.
